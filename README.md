In this repository, I've saved my **HTML-CSS-JavaScript Website**.

It contains a folder with various **CSS objects** I found online, which may come in handy in the future. Thereâ€™s also a folder for the **training** I completed to familiarize myself with **HTML and CSS**. Lastly, the **Website** folder includes all its components.

The website is a **voting page** for a hypothetical **school trip**, where classmates can view details about different destinations and cast their votes.

Please note that this website was built from a **template** due to my limited knowledge of basic website structure. However, it successfully achieved the goal of helping me become familiar with _framework-less_ **web development**.
